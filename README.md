# NodeMCU-MPU6050-Remote-Controlled-Car-with-OLED-Display
This project demonstrates how to build a remote-controlled car using a NodeMCU ESP8266, an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope module, and an SSD1306 OLED display. The car utilizes the data from the MPU6050 to control its multi-directional motion using mecanum wheels.
